Project Description

This Java console application simulates a Gradebook and Utility tool designed to demonstrate core programming concepts including:

- Object-oriented design with classes and methods
- User input handling using Scanner
- Control flow with if/else, switch, and all loop types (for, while, do-while, for-each)
- Exception handling with try/catch
- Type casting and operator precedence
- Recursion with a countdown utility

Users can add students, input grades, view averages and letter grades, and explore utility demos via a menu-driven interface.

 Project Structure

- Main.java – Contains the main menu loop, input handling, and utility demos.
- Student.java – Defines the Student class with fields, methods, and grade logic.

Features Implemented

- Add and manage multiple students using ArrayList<Student>
- Input validation with exception handling
- Grade calculation and letter grade assignment
- Utility demos:
  - Operator precedence
  - Type casting (int ↔ double)
  - Recursion countdown
- Full loop coverage:
  - for loop for grade input
  - while loop for main menu
  - do-while for repeat prompts
  - for-each for listing students
